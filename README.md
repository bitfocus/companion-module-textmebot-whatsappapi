Some recommendations to avoid getting your phone number blocked by WhatsApp
1) Implement a delay between messages (min. 5 seconds). The more the better.
2) Do not send messages to people that you do not know.
3) It is recommended to have the recipient of the message in your phone contact list
4) Use a dedicated phone number for the API. If WhatsApp block your number, you do not loose your personal chats, images, contacts, documents, etc.
5) A loop in your code will send 100s of message and whatsapp will block your number. Be careful!
